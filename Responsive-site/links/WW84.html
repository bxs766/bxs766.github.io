  <section class="description">

    <h3> In the sequel to 2017's smash hit, "Wonder Woman", Wonder Woman finds herself in 1984. Times are changing and the music is great, and somehow her former boyfriend, Steve Trevor, is back from the dead. Diana will also run into Cheetah, played by Kristen Wiig, who may or may not be the film's villain. Less ambiguous is the fact that Pedro Pascal, star of "The Mandalorian", is playing the film's main villain.

        <h2> In 2017, Wonder Woman was the year's highest grossing superhero film domestically. This year, it has a chance to be the highest grossing film of any kind domestically, as it hopes to build off of its predecessor's success. The film's 80s setting should prove to be a boon commercially, as nostalgia for that decade is high.
