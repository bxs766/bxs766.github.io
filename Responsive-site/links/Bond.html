  <h3> No Time To Die is the 25th film in the James Bond franchise. It releases on April 10th, and is expected to be the number one film of the month. It picks up from "Spectre", the last film in the franchise. It hopes to give Craig's Bond a fitting send off while also wrapping up the overall arc of his series.
