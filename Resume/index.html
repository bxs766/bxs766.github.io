<h2> <div class="hello"> About Me </div> </h2>

<div class="hello">  <p>I am currently a <b>sophomore</b> at the <b>University of Miami</b>. </div>I expect to graduate in May 2022 with a double major in <strong> <div class="movies"> Motion Pictures and Theatre Arts </div> </strong> and a minor in <strong> <div class="movies"> Media Management. </div> </strong> I hope to become a
    writer-director-actor in the film industry. During the summer after my freshman year of college, I co-wrote, co-directed, and starred in an <em>original feature length film</em> entitled <em><div class="rewrites">"Rewrites".</div></em> Additionally, when I was a senior in
    high school, I was nominated for the <em><a href="https://papermill.org/">Paper Mill Playhouse</a> Rising Star Award for Outstanding Lead Actor</em> for my performance as <i>Jean Valjean</i> in my high school's production of <i>Les
      Miserables</i>. I have the experience, skillset, and knowledge base to succeed as a writer, actor, and director. I am also proficient in editing, cinematography, and sound. I will do any job I am asked to do, and will be happy to work as long
    as it is in the <div class="sandwiches"> entertainment industry. </div>
