  <h3> The Mad House </h3> <br>

  <h4> This was the first short film I directed in college. While filming, I was still mastering how to use a new camera, but this film taught me a lot about getting coverage. I realized it's always better to have more footage than less. </h4> <br>
  <h3> Rewrites </h3> <br>
  <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_6033.PNG"> </div>
  <h4> This was my first feature film, and I co-directed it with a friend. Co-directing proved to be challenging at times, as we often had different ideas for how to stage scenes. However, this was a great learning experience for me as I learned first hand how important it is to be collaborative on set. </h4> <br>
  <h3> Matchmaker in College </h3> <br>
  <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_4043.JPG"> </div>
  <h4> This directing experience was different than many of my other ones because I had a smaller role as an actor. This enabled me to be more hands on behind the camera as a director. We filmed this film with 3 cameras, so as to create the feeling of a real reality show, but that made it very difficult to coordinate at times. We also used wireless microphones for sound, as we filmed on the beach. Dealing with all of these moving parts in this production taught me a lot about how best to run a set as a director. <h4>
