      <h3> Chip Tripped </h3> <br>
      <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_0635.PNG"> </div>
      <h4> In Chip Tripped, I starred as Chippy Matthews, an internet vlogger who becames a global meme after falling while vlogging. This was some of my first work acting for film, rather than theater, and after watching the finished project, it taught me a lot about how best to play to the camera and adjust my acting techniques for film. </h4> <br>
      <h3> Rewrites </h3> <br>
      <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_3017.jpg"> </div>
      <h4> In Rewrites, I starred as Brad Russell, a screenwriter who was just written the worst movie of all time. This was my first starring role in a feature length film. It taught me a lot about how to be a lead actor in a feature. When filming a feature, rather than a short, the filming days are long and the filming schedule can last for months. The lead actor has to bring the same energy to set every single day and is reponsible for setting an example for the rest of the cast. Acting in Rewrites allowed me to learn this first hand. </h4> <br>
      <h3> Matchmaker in College </h3> <br>
      <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_4092.JPG"> </div>
      <h4> In Matchmaker in College, I had a smaller role as Bhris Clarrison, the host of the reality dating show. The character begins as a sort of caricature of a reality TV show host, before dropping the facade at the end and showing everyone that he is in fact an outright villain underneath the facade. In order to play this character, I had to master both of his dimensions: the thin caricature, and the evil menace. I also had the ability to improv with this role, which allowed me to make a lot of funny jokes off the cuff that made it into the final film. </h4> <br>
