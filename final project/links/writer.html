    <h2> Major Writing Credits </h2> <br>

    </div>


  <h3> Chip Tripped: The Ruse of a Lifetime </h3> <br>
  <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_1488.PNG"> </div>
  <h4> This film was the sequel to "Chip Tripped", which was written and directed by my friend. So it was a challenge to take existing voices and craft a satisfying follow up, but my experience writing this gave me the skills I needed to do it again in the future. </h4> <br>
  <h3> Rewrites </h3> <br>
  <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_2974.PNG"> </div>
  <h4> Rewrites was my first feature length film, and I co-wrote the script with a friend of mine. It was a new experience to work with a co-writer, and we didn't always agree on everythhing. But having this experience taught me how to write collaboratively, and how to craft a story with a collaborator. </h4> <br>
  <h3> Matchmaker in College </h3> <br>
  <div class="ing"> <img src="../images/IMG_4238.PNG"> </div>
  <h4> This is probably the most fun I've ever had writing a screenplay. Since it was parodying a reality television show, I got to write it as people would actually talk off the cuff, rather than how they talk in movies. I also left room for some improvisation in the script, which led to a funnier product once we finished filming. </h4> <br>
